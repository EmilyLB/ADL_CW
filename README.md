This is a repository for the Applied Deep Learning Coursework.

We reproduced the work done by Schindler et al. in _Comparing Shallow versus Deep Neural Network Architectures for Automatic Music Genre Classification_ to produce their shallow CNN model. We then implemented their extension of stratified 4-fold cross-validation. To improve the accuarcy of the genre classification, we used transfer learning. The existing model we used for the transfer learning extension is _Resnet18_ and we made use of methods applied by Mehta et al. in _Music Genre Clas-
sification using Transfer Learning on log-based MEL Spectrogram_.

We used _Python_ to create the model and _TensorFlow_ to produce visualisations.
