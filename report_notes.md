Questions:
1. what do we actually submit - just one file with shallow and then extensions?
2. how many confusion matrix do we need? Either 100 epochs or 200 epochs or both?
3. our shuffling in cross validation


If we magically find ourselves with more time:
1. early stopping curve
2. Trying out different models again (resnet-34 and resnet-50)
3. Try again an alternative method to looping through each image in ext_2.
